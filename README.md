# Predicting-Next-Hour-Temperature
## Objective
The task is to predict the temperature of the next hour based on the climate conditions and temperature over the last 24 hours. This is a multivariate, timeseries forecasting problem.

## Data Description
The dataset contains weather conditions recorded at the Weather Station at the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry in Jena, Germany, over several years. In this dataset, 14 different quantities (including air temperature, atmospheric pressure and humidity) were recorded every 10 minutes.

The original data goes back to 2003, but we use a subset for this competition, from 2009 to 2016 (both inclusive). Also for our competition, we use a further reduced version in which recordings are kept for every hour.
